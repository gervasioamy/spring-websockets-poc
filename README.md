# spring-websockets-poc

This is just a proof of concepts of spring suppot for websockets (STOMP over Web Sockets by the way)
In order to test it, a very basic chat application server was done

## Stack Backend
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security

## Stack Frontend
- sockjs
- stompjs
- jquery
- HTML + CSS (Bootstrap)


> NOTE: Please ignore the web. The focus of this poc was the server and websockets, 
> it would be desirable to develop a better SPA web with Angular for ex. (to be done later)
> the most important at this point is how to connect and subscribe
